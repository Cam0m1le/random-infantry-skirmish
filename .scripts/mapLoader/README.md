# Map loader

This set of scripts is intended for initialization of template for specific island.

It searches for locations and builds markers on their positions.

## Usage

1. Create mission on desired island
2. Copy included scripts to the mission folder
3. Run the mission
4. Paste clipboard contents to `mission.sqm` file of the mission
5. Reload mission

Your mission now has same settings as all other RIS missions and it has prebuilt set of markers on important locations. You're now free to do minor corrections of the markers (usually they're few meters off) and to add your own locations. Once you're done, copy the mission.sqm to `.templates/[Island name].sqm`
